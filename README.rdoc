= annotate_emails

Useful when tickets come from emails, with the following params :  unknown_user=accept no_permission_check=1

By default, in Redmine, it sets the ticket reporter as anonymous user if the From email does not belong to a known user.

This plugin adds a custom field, `sender_email` and populates this field with the From email.
